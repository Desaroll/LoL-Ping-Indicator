# LoL-Ping-Indicator
A little tool to approximately test current ping to LoL's servers.

You have the Code::Blocks's proyect files for those who use it. If you use another IDE, use them as base to determine dependences and all that stuff.

Not warraty. If it breaks, you can keep both pieces.

I may or may not work futher on this.
